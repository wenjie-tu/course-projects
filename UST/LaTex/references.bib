TITLE = {Assessing Impacts of New Subway Stations on Urban Thefts in the Surrounding Areas},

ABSTRACT = {Whether newly implemented public transit stations influence the nearby crime pattern has been debated for years. In ZG City, China, 2 new subway lines and 20 new stations were implemented in 2017. This intervention allows us to test the plausible relationship between new public transit stations and thefts in the surrounding areas. We use the difference-in-differences (DID) model to assess the theft in the treatment and control areas before and after the implementation of the new stations, with necessary socioeconomic and land-use variables and time from the addition of the station being controlled. We also explicitly examine the impacts of the proximity of the stations and the Spring Festival on theft. The results suggest the following: (1) theft around the new subway stations significantly increases after the stations’ implementation, while the control area does not see much change in thefts; (2) proximity between the neighboring stations’ increases thefts; and (3) theft near the new stations significantly decreases during the month of the Spring Festival. This study contributes to the literature on the relationship between the subway system and crime, especially from a Chinese perspective. The finding of the research can bring insights to urban transit planning, allocation of the police force, and crime prevention.},
